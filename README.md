# drag_drop_listview_example
Came across this Use Flutter to drag and drop items within the ListView to other locations and also drag the whole listview around.


# Introduction

Drag and drop is typical mobile application interaction. As the user long presses (at times called touch and hold) on a widget, another widget shows up underneath the user’s finger, and the user drags the widget to a last area and deliveries it.

Drag and drop is important interaction in mobile apps. This article is about a simple demo application using flutter Drag and Drop. If you’re trying to use these widgets in real life application, hope this article will help you.

In this demo, you’ll build a drag-and-drop interaction where the user presses on a choice of fruit name, and then drags that name to the picture of the correct fruit.
